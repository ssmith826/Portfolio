Personal Portfolio to showcase projects
Here is my personal portfolio page, here I will showcase my weddevelopment and coding projects and work, for prospective empolyeers and as a fun collection of my own work. 
Currently I have only uploaded one project to the to the portfolio, as that is all that I have completed in my time at coding bootcamp. I do look forwarded to adding many more porjects as I advance my knowledge, and my career.
